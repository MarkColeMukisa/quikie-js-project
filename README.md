# Payroll App

## Overview

The Payroll App is a simple web-based application that calculates an employee's payroll. Users can input the employee's name, the number of hours worked, and the hourly rate. Upon clicking the "Calculate" button, the application computes the gross pay, applies a 10% tax deduction, and then calculates the net pay. The results are displayed dynamically in a table format.

## Features

- **Easy Data Entry:** Input fields for employee name, hours worked, and hourly rate.
- **Real-time Calculation:** Compute gross pay, tax deduction (10%), and net pay via jQuery when the calculate button is clicked.
- **Dynamic Record Display:** Appends calculated payroll records into a table for easy viewing.
- **Simple, Clean UI:** Basic styling using CSS ensures a user-friendly experience.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** Structure of the application.
- **CSS:** Styling and layout design.
- **JavaScript:** Core logic for payroll calculations.
- **jQuery:** Handling UI events and DOM manipulation.
